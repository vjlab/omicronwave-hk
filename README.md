## Abstract
After keeping infections at bay for two years through comprehensive surveillance and stringent public health measures, Hong Kong experienced a surge of Omicron BA.2 infections in early 2022. The resulting BA.2 wave overwhelmed the health care system, isolation facilities, and contact tracing capacity, leading to one of the highest per-capita death rates of COVID-19 in early 2022. The outbreak occurred against a backdrop of high population density with little prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and low vaccination rates among vulnerable people due to high vaccine hesitancy. We have integrated genome sequences and epidemiological data from this time to reconstruct the epidemic trajectory of the BA.2 wave, estimate transmission and incidence rates, and evaluate the effectiveness of policy changes. We identify an increase in effective reproductive rate (Re) to 9.5 in mid-January 2022, which preceded real-time estimates of transmission (Rt), revealing that BA.2 community transmission was under-ascertained weeks before the epidemic appeared to surge in mid-February 2022. Due to this, public health measures were relaxed in early February (Spring Festival) while Re increased and remained above 1 throughout February. An independent estimation of point prevalence and incidence using phylodynamics also suggests extensive superspreading at this time, which likely contributed to the rapid expansion of the epidemic. This study demonstrates that relying on Rt estimation methods dependent on case reporting can misinform epidemic response planning, sometimes with substantial health consequences. There is a need for future research and implementation of improved estimates of epidemic growth in near real-time that combine multiple disparate data sources to inform outbreak response policies better.
